I'm writing a python script to cut longer MP3 files (i.e. recordings of several songs) into the individual tracks. 

It's a rather simple program with a very non-polished GUI so far. Feel free to use it and report any problems that occur. 

I'm planning to rework the GUI a bit and, if I can do it in a useful way, implement the possibility to record system sound of the computer directly in the program. 
Until then, you'll have to use a program like audacity first to record the original, long MP3.

The maximum length of the input MP3 is, to my knowledge, slightly above five hours. 
I suspect that RAM is the limiting factor, so if you have more than 8 GB of RAM, longer input files may work, too.
